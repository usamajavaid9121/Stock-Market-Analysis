## Project Overview

The stock market analysis project aims to analyze historical stock price data and gain insights into trends and patterns. It involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: Obtain historical stock price data for the desired company/companies from reliable sources such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl.

2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handle missing values, adjust for stock splits or dividends, and align the data for analysis.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform initial analysis, visualize stock price trends over time, calculate basic statistics, and identify any outliers or anomalies.

4. Feature Engineering: Create additional features from the stock price data, such as moving averages, technical indicators, or volatility measures.

5. Predictive Modeling: Build predictive models using machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, or more advanced methods like LSTM for time series analysis.

6. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the predictive models using appropriate evaluation metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or accuracy. Compare the results against a baseline or benchmark model.

7. Visualization and Reporting: Present the findings and insights through visualizations, such as line plots, candlestick charts, or portfolio performance plots. Document the analysis process and results to showcase your work.
